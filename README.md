# Project philo

# Goal
philosophers is a C project that simulates the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, a common synchronization and concurrency problem in computer science. The simulation involves multiple philosophers sitting at a table, sharing resources (forks) while trying to avoid deadlock and starvation.

# Features
Simulation: Model the behavior of philosophers eating and thinking at a table.
Concurrency: Use threads to handle simultaneous actions by philosophers.
Resource Management: Implement mechanisms to avoid deadlock and ensure fair access to resources.
